DOMESDAY BOOK
But to return
To Elenor Murray, I have made a book
Called Domesday Book, a census spiritual
Taken of our America, or in part
Taken, not wholly taken, it may be.
For William Merival, the coroner,
Who probed the death of Elenor lVIurray goes
As far as may be, and beyond his power,
In diagnosis of America,
While finding out the cause of death. In short
Becomes a William the Conqueror that way
In making up a Domesday Book for us. . . .
Of this a little later. But before
We touch upon the Domesday book of old,
We take up Elenor Murray, show her birth;
Then skip all time between and show her death;
Then take up Coroner Merival— who was he?
Then trace the life of Elenor Murray through
The witnesses at the inquest on the body
Of Elenor Murray; —-- also letters written,
And essays written, conversations heard,
But all evoked by Elenor Murray’s death.
And by the way trace rifiles here and there. . . .
A word now on the Domesday book of old:
Remember not a book of doom, but a book
Of houses; domus, house, so domus book.
And this book of the death of Elenor Murray
Is not a book of doom, though showing too
How fate was woven round her, and the souls
That touched her soul; but is a house book too

DOM ESDAY BOOK
Of riches, poverty, and weakness, strength
Of this our country.
If you take St. Luke
You find an angel came to Mary, said:
Hail! thou art highly favored, shalt conceive,
Bring forth a son, a king for David’s throne :—
So tracing life before the life was born.
We do the same for Elenor Murray, though
No man or angel said to Elenor’s mother:
You have found favor, you are blessed of God,
You shall conceive, bring forth a daughter blest,
And blessing you. Quite otherwise the case,
As being blest or blessing, something like
Perhaps, in that desire, or flame of life,
Which gifts new souls with passion, strength and love. . . .
This is die manner of the girl’s conception,
And of her birth:— . . .
THE BIRTH OF ELENOR MURRAY
What are the mortal facts
With which we deal? The man is thirty years,
Most vital, in a richness physical,
Of musical heart and feeling; and the woman
Is twenty-eight, a cradle warm and rich
For life to grow in.
And the time is this:
This Henry Murray has a mood of peace,

THE BIRTH OF ELENOR MURRAY
A splendor as of June, has for the time
Quelled anarchy Within him, come to law,
Sees life a thing of beauty, happiness,
And fortune glow before him. And the mother,
Sunning her feathers in his genial light,
Takes longing and has hope. For body's season
The blood of youth leaps in them like a fountain,
And splashes musically in the crystal pool
Of quiet days and hours. They rise refreshed,
Feel all the sun’s strength flow through muscles, nerves;
Extract from food no poison, only health;
Are sensitive to simple things, the turn
Of leaves on trees, flowers springing, robins’ songs.
Now such a time must prosper love’s desire,
Fed gently, tended wisely, left to mount
In flame and light. A prospering fate occurs
To send this Henry TMurray from his wife,
And keep him absent for a month — inspire
A daily letter, written of the joys,
And hopes they have together, and omit,
Forgotten for the time, old aches, despairs,
Forebodings for the future.
What results?
For thirty days her youth, and youthful blood
Under the stimulus of absence, letters,
And growing longing, laves and soothes and feeds,
Like streams that nourish fields, her body’s being.
Enriches cells to plumpness, dim, asleep,
Which stretch, expand and turn, the prototype
